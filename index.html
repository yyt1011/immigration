        Where do companies able to hire foreign employees locate in the U.S.
      </h2>
      <div id="intro">
        <p>
          The idea of this project was originated when a friend of mine, who was
          put into a long waiting period to find out if her current employer was
          willing to complete an Employment Eligibility Verification form (known
          as E-Verify).
        </p>
        <p>
          According to USCIS, all U.S. employers must verify the employment
          eligibility and identify of all their employees working in the US.
          While it is not required for students using 12-month OPT, an employer
          that's enrolled in USCIS's E-Verify program is a must for an STEM OPT
          student to legally work and maintain their status in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, E-Verify is a only voluntary program. But if a
          company wants to hire a foreigh employee in permanent basis, it must
          obtain a foreign labor certificate. The Department of Labor has
          approved more than 30,000 application for Permanent Employment
          Certification between October 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the more than 32,000 cases that the department either approved
          or denied during the six-month period, most of them had a process time
          (between the date on which the department received the case and the
          deicsion date of the case) for less than a year. However, some cases
          had process time of several years.
