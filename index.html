      where do companies that are able to hire foreign employees locate in the
      U.S.
    </h1>
    <p>
      The idea of this project was originated when a friend of mine, who was one
      year into her three-year STEM OPT, was put into a long waiting period to
      find out if her current employer was willing to complete an Employment
      Eligibility Verification form (known as E-Verify). <br />
      According to USCIS, all U.S. employers must verify the employment
      eligibility and identify of all their employees working in the US. While
      it is not required for students using 12-month OPT, an employer that's
      enrolled in USCIS's E-Verify program is a must for an STEM OPT student.
      <br />
      That being said, E-Verify is a voluntary program. However, a foreign labor
      certification must be obtained by a company that wants hire foreign
      employees in permanent basis.<br />
      The Department of Labor has approved more than 30,000 application for
      Permanent Employment Certification between October 1, 2019 through March
      31, 2020. The process time of these cases range from as long as 10 years
      to several months.
